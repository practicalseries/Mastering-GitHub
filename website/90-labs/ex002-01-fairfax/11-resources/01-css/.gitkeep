# Title :          FOLDER PLACEHOLDER                                    .GITKEEP
# *******************************************************************************
# 
# DETAILS
# 
# This is an empty placeholder file.
# 
# The Git and GitHub version control system will always ignore empty folders and
# will exclude them from the version control repository.
# 
# With website development it is important to maintain the correct folder 
# structure and the inclusion of empty folders within that structure is
# necessary.
# 
# The purpose of this file is to force Git and GitHub to include folders that 
# would otherwise be empty and thus not included in the repository.
# 
# There is a somewhat unofficial convention within the Git community that 
# such files are called .gitkeep.
